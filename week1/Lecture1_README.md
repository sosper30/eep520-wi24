Software Engineering For Embedded Applications
===

Introduction and Build Environment
---

Modern embedded systems programming starts with the hardware and extends all the way to the cloud. The resulting myriad of programming languages, libraries, tools, data structures, and algorithms may seem difficult for any one programmer to master. In this course, we introduce the fundamentals of programming languages and software engineering common to all levels of embedded systems programming, giving students the conceptual tools they need to tackle any project.

        - Lecture notes in week_1/README.md (go there now)
    - Your homework repo (more on this later)
- **Docker**: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
    - You need it on your laptop

Build Environment
===
- To keep track of, and share code, we will use Github
- To unify our build environment, we will use Docker
    - UNIX environment
    - bash shell
    - gnu C and C++ compiler
    - make build tool
- We will try to all use the same editor

Code Editor
===

- A very good editor for the C and C++ code is VS Code.
- Free: [https://code.visualstudio.com/](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- Has syntax highlighting, autocomplete, extensions.
- Other editors we like: Atom, Sublime.
- You might like vim, emacs – but we expect you know how to use them.

Git
===

**Git** is a version control software. You can:
- Save a specific version of your code.
- See differences with previous versions.
- Tag versions.
- Roll back.
- Fork, branch, merge, etc.

**Github** is a way for collaborative teams to work on the same code base.

Github Accounts
===
- Make an account (if you don't have one) [here](https://github.com/join?source=header-home).

Installing Git
===

Mac
---
- Install the Xcode Command Line Tools. These tools include git.
- Or you can download the app - search for "github for Mac"

Windows
---
- Go to [https://git-scm.com/download/win](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Course Code
===

Make a code directory for the course and make it your working directory (Optional: use Terminal for MacOs or the Command line for Windows PCs).

Get the code for the course:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sosper30/eep520-wi24
OR
git clone git@github.com:sosper30/eep520-wi24.git
```
Nowadays git uses extra layer of protection when cloning private repositories from github, you need to check [this](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/about-remote-repositories#cloning-with-https-urls) before cloning any private repository like eep520.

Each week, we will add more code and README files. So you should do:
```bash
git pull origin main
```
to get the latest code.

Git setup for homework
===

- Git is a version control system.
- Git should be easy to install on any OS
- Go to Github and make a new repo called 520-Assignments (*with no README*)
- Make the repo **private**
- Invite Professor, and the TAs to your repo
- Follow these steps to invite someone on your git repo        [here](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)
- Our git usernames are: **sosper30**, **SanjarNormuradov**, **Sarmagan**, and **trungleUW**.

Then do

```
mkdir 520-Assignments
cd 520-Assignments
touch README.md                # touch command creates a new file on the local machine.
git init
git add .
git commit -m "first commit"
git branch -M main  # (Optional) rename the current branch from "master" to "main"
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/520-Assignments.git
git push -u origin main # If you didn't rename the branch from "master" to "main", then do "git push -u origin master"
// edit and/or add some files
git add .
git commit -m "Changed some files"
git -u push origin main
```

Go back to Github to see your changes. Your student account should give you the ability to make private repos (so other students will not see your code).

Resulting set up
===

Somewhere on your hard drive you should now have

```bash
  Code/
    eep520/
      README.md
      week_1/
        fractions/
        hello_c/
        hello_cpp/
        Dockerfile
        README.md
    520-Assignments/
      README.md
```

The Github repo for `eep520` is managed by Professor Sep Makhsous. The Github repo for `520-Assignments` is managed by you.

How we will use Git
===

- We will assign exercises each week.
- Push your final code for the assignment in your repository, for example, `520-Assignments/hw_1`.
- After pushing your code to the GitHub, make a **release** so that we can get the notification of that version of your code you uploaded.
- Please follow these steps to make a release:
- Step 1:
- Under Releases section click on create a new release button.

- Step 2:
- You need to choose a tag before publishing your release, you can make your own tag as shown in the image.

- Step 3:
- After creating your tag, complete steps 2,3,4 in the image.

- We will clone your repo on Sundays mid-day (or there about).
- For C and C++ exercises, we will replace `unit_test.c` with our own `unit_test.c` and recompile your code. We will put our scripts up on Github (leaving out some details) for you to use and test your code.
- <span style="color: red">It is important to name your functions and classes exactly as we specify so that the tests will compile.</span>

Docker
===

**Problem:**
- You all run various versions of Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.
- We need a common environment.
- So does any company that develops software.
- Production environment should match development environment.

**The solution:** Docker
- Let’s you define a unix environment with exactly the pre-requisites your code needs.

Virtualization
===

<img width=70%
     src="https://www.nakivo.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/Docker-containers-are-not-lightweight-virtual-machines.png">

- Requires Virtualization (e.g. Intel, AMD, ARM and MIPS)
- On Linux, Docker uses the same kernel, but with a different namespace and filesystem.
- On Mac, Docker uses xhyve, a hypervisor that creates a completely sandboxed kernel space.
- On Windows, Docker uses Hyper-V. Also gives you a Unix like command shell.

Example Dockerfile
===

```
# Layer 1: Start with ubuntu with the gnu development environment installed
FROM gcc  

# Layer 2: Packages managed by ubuntu's package manager
RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y cmake && \
    apt-get install -y cppcheck && \
    apt-get install -y graphviz && \
    apt-get install -y doxygen && \
    apt-get install -y nano

# Layer 3: Google test
WORKDIR /usr/src
RUN git clone https://github.com/google/googletest.git
WORKDIR /usr/src/googletest/install
RUN cmake ../ && make && make install

# Layer 3: Move to a good directory to start working
WORKDIR /source
```

You can either use docker to build an "image" with all this stuff installed.

Or you can use pre-build images in the Dockerfile for this course, available at

> [https://hub.docker.com/r/klavins/ecep520](https://hub.docker.com/r/klavins/ecep520).

To download the image, run in a terminal window the following command:
```
docker pull klavins/ecep520:cppenv
```

Installing Docker
===

Mac
---
- Go to https://www.docker.com/

Download `Docker.dmg` and double click on it. Once the Docker icon shows up in your status bar, you can open a terminal and start using docker.

Windows 10 Professional or Enterprise
---
- Go to https://www.docker.com/
- Download and run installer
- Note: Go to UWARE/Microsoft ad upgrade from Win 10 to "Win 10 for education"

Windows 10 Home and possibly Windows 8
---
- Go to https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/toolbox_install_windows/
- Download and run installer
- Run Docker Quickstart

Unix
---
```
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Starting the Docker Image for the course
===

Vocabulary:
- **image**: stateless set of files in a filesystem
- **container**: A running unix kernel using that filesystem

Make sure you downloaded the image with the following command in a terminal window:
```
docker pull klavins/ecep520:cppenv
```

To mount the `week1` directory in a docker container and access the shell within the container, do:
```bash
docker run -v $PWD/week1:/source -it klavins/ecep520:cppenv bash
```
on a Mac or Linux.

On windows you will have to use the full path, as in
```bash
docker run -v /c/Users/You/Code/EEP520-W20/week1:/source -it klavins/ecep520:cppenv bash
```

The current directory will be mounted as though it were a disk drive at the container directory `/source`, which is also where you'll be when you start the image.

**Note:** Files is the mounted directory can be edited from the host machine.

**Note:** If you start and stop and restart a container, all changes to the image are lost.

UNIX: Filesystem
===

- `pwd`: Print the current directory. Should be `/source` when you start
- `cd`: Change to a new directory
    - `..` is the parent directory
    - `.` is the current directory
    - `/` is the root directory
    - `~` is your home directory
- `ls`: List the current directory
    - Try `ls -laF` to see more details.
    - Try `ls /usr/bin/g*` to list all files in `/usr/bin` that start with the letter `g`
- `mkdir`: Make a new directory
    - Try `mkdir temp`
- `mv a b`: move `a` to file name or directory `b`
- `cp a b`: copy a file from a to `b`
    - To move a directory, do `mv -r a b`

**Exercise:**
  - Copy the file README.md to `/tmp/README_copy.md`
  - List the `/tmp` directory and find out how big the copied file is and when it was last modified

UNIX: Important Places
===
- `/usr` stands for Unix System Resources
- `/usr/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`: Command line tools, like `ls`. `bin` means binary.
- `/usr/lib`, `/usr/local/lib`: Library files like DLLs.
- `/usr/include`, `/usr/local/include`: Header files that declare function and data types in libraries.
- `/etc` important configuration files
- `/dev` devices. These are not really files. Unix makes devices look like files, so you read and write to them to control devices.

**Exercises:**
- The `cat x` command outputs the contents of the file x. Look in the file `/usr/include/limits.h` and determine the maximum size of an integer, by finding the definition of the macro `INT_MAX`.
If you don't have neither `include` folder nor `limits.h` file, create one and fill the `limits.h` file with [this content](https://sites.uclouvain.be/SystInfo/usr/include/limits.h.html).

UNIX: Text files
===
- `cat`: Display the contents of a file
- `more`: Display large files. Use space bar to advance.
- `head`: Show the begninning of a file. Try `head -5 /usr/include/limits.h`
- `tail`: Show the end of a file. Try `tails -5 /usr/include/limits.h`
- `nano`: Edit a file.
- `a > b` put output of command `a` in file `b`
- `a >> b` append output of command `a` to file `b`

**Exercises:**
- Create a file called `/tmp/repeats.txt` containing 10 lines all equal to the first line of `/usr/include/limits.h`. Use `head` and `>>`.

UNIX: Searching
===
- `grep x y`: Find occurances of the string (or regular expression) x in file y.
    - Can also do a set of files as in `grep MAX /usr/include/*.h`
- `|` send the output of one command to the input of another, as in `tail -100 /usr/include/limits.h | grep POSIX`

**Exercises:**
- Use `grep` to find the definition of `INT_MIN` in `limits.h`

UNIX: Processes
===
- `ps`: List running processes. Use `ps waux` for more all processes (not just yours). Note, containers are not usually running many system processes.
- `jobs`: Similar to `ps` but lists processes you have started and put in the background.
- `kill x`: Kill process `x`
- `ctrl-Z`: pause the currently running, forground process.
- `&`: To run a process in the background initially, add `&` to the end of the command.
- `bg`: Put the most recently paused process in the background.
- `fg`: Put the most recently backgrounded process in the foreground.

**Exercises:**
- Run the command `sleep 1000`, which does nothing, for 1000 seconds.
- Put the process into the background.
- Use ps to find out its process id
- Use kill to kill the process.

**Exercise: UNIX File Management Basics**
Objective
The goal of this exercise is to familiarize yourself with basic UNIX commands for managing files and directories.

Tasks
Create a New Directory

Use the mkdir command to create a new directory named UnixExercise in your home directory.
Navigate to the New Directory

Change your current working directory to UnixExercise using the cd command.
Create Files

Within UnixExercise, create three empty files named file1.txt, file2.txt, and file3.txt. You can use the touch command for this.
List Files

Use the ls command to list all the files in UnixExercise.
Write Content to a File

Use a text editor like nano or vi to open file1.txt and write a few lines of text in it. Save and exit the editor.
Display File Content

Use the cat command to display the contents of file1.txt.
Copy a File

Copy file1.txt to a new file named file1_backup.txt using the cp command.
Rename a File

Rename file2.txt to file2_renamed.txt using the mv command.
Move a File

Create a new directory inside UnixExercise named Backup.
Move file1_backup.txt to the Backup directory.
Delete a File

Delete file3.txt using the rm command.
Bonus Task: View Directory Structure

Use the tree command to view the structure of UnixExercise. (Install the tree package if it's not already installed on your system.)

More UNIX Resources
===

If you are new to Linux, go through a tutorial, such as the one at [linuxcommand.org](http://linuxcommand.org/).

Do the "Learning the Shell" part.

Don't worry about writing scripts for now.

Compiling and Running C Code
===

To compile the hello world example, do the following from within in the `cppenv` bash shell:
```bash
cd hello_c                      # change directory
ls                              # see what's in the directory
gcc -c hello.c                  # compile hello.c into hello.o
gcc -c main.c                   # compile main.c into main.o
gcc -o hello *.o                # link the two .o files to make an executable
ls -l                           # show all the new files
./hello                         # run the new execuable
```

Compiling C++ Code
===

From within in the `cppenv` bash shell,
```bash
cd hello_cpp
g++ -c hello.cc
g++ -c main.cc
g++ -o hello *.o
./hello
```

Compiling Tests and Linking Libraries
===

In the fractions directory is a simple Fraction api and some unit tests for it. These tests use [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest), a library that the `cppenv` Docker container already has installed in it. To build the executable for the fractions tests, do
```bash
cd fractions
g++ -c fraction.c -std=c++17
g++ -c unit_tests.c -std=c++17
g++ -c main.c -std=c++17
g++ -o test *.o fraction.h -lgtest -lpthread
```
Note that although the Fraction api is written in C, the test library is written in C++, so we use the `g++` compiler and linker to build the code. Also, Google Test uses the C++11 standard, which is not the default for C++, so we have to tell g++ top use it. Finally, the linker needs to know to link the shared object library for Google Test, called `gtest`, and also the PThread library, called `pthread`, which Google Test users.

To run the tests in `unit_tests.c`, simply do
```bash
./test
```

How the Fractions code works
===

**Exercise:** Write a test to verify that 1/2 plus 1/2 is 1.

Using a Makefile
===
Having to type `g++` commands over and over is tedious. To manage the build process, we will use [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). The fractions directory has a Makefile in it with generic definitions for making a new project. To run make, just do
```bash
make
```
from within the fractions directory. This will make two new directories, `bin` and `build`. The former will have the executable, test, in it. The latter will have all the `*.o` files. Then it builds and links everything.

To documentation, which turns comments in the code into an html browsable form, you can do
```bash
make docs
```
Don't worry about documentation for now.

You can clean up by doing
```bash
make clean
```
or
```bash
make spotless
```
to really clean up.
